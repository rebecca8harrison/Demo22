As an Argentinian fan for me the problem since the start of the game was the referee, what Paredes did against the dutch bench was red card, what Van Dijk did against Paredes pushing him was red card too, what happened in penalties with both teams was bad sportmanship also with Messi attitude 

I think this all comes from the performance of the referee Mateu La hoz, who lost control of the match by taking stupid decisions and making players get irritated in both teams and not knowing how to take the control back. It was the match to get in semifinals and you have to control the game because the teams are fighting for an important match and it will be very easy to get the game out of control and thats what happened.

Anyways all respect for dutch fans and players, was a good and intense game.",1670682010.0

Argentina will be bossed around in midfield unless Messi drops even deeper. Modric isnt human, I'm sure of that, the guy makes the energizer bunny look old. But Messi doesn't need much, just that one touch.

Argentina would be well advised not to try any of their shithousery against the Croats, if they try to intimidate them or Otamendi tries to kick them out, they'll get flattened.

Just an idea but what do you think of a team made up of players whose countries did not qualify for the world cup. The coach can only choose a squad of 25 players from countries that did not qualify and they would compete as ‚ÄúRest of World‚Äù.  It would be interesting because they might actually be somewhat decent with so many stars never having the chance to play in the WC because of their weak national teams. 

Imagine a team with Salah, Haaland, Odegaard, Auba, Zlatan, Luis Diaz, Zaha, Kessie, Oismen, Almiron, Alaba, Mahrez, James, Robertson, Zinchenko, Kvaratskhelia, Oblak, and a handfull of Italian players of course. 

It would still be pretty difficult to get chosen for this team since it is still up to the coach for the call up. 

I mainly suggest this idea because its crazy knowing that some amazing players will probably never even step foot in a WC because of their weak NT and i think it would be cool for them to have the chance.  I know a lot of people would be mad if this multinational team were to beat their country but maybe even if they just played group rounds and then a wildcard country could move on in place of them to knockout rounds idk.  But still not a bad idea.

Is it because:

1/ The new weird way of ""mind-games"" so to speak between penalty kicker and the goalie which seems to  have moved up another notch?

(The penalty kicker seems to be more elaborate and hesitant in the running to the spot to kick the ball with a ""low-power low shot"" - They no longer prefer the method of putting their foot through the ball and walloping  it to the goal as before  and the goal keeper seems to fake their move - moves to one side slightly and then dives to another direction - right before the kick too).

2/ Quality of goalie in guessing the shot directions. Are goalkeepers penalty techniques getting better now?

3/ The domino psychological effect of the first failed shot seems to be more prominent in this World Cup means more emotional pressure on players this time compared to previous World cup?

4/ Some teams do not prioritize practice penalty shoot-out enough?",1670537321.0

There has been a lot of talk lately about who the goat is.Some people say Ronaldo while others say Messi.What some people don‚Äôt get is that they are both really good but Messi is more of a team player .Ronaldo is more of a shooter than a passer and he always directs the ball to himself.That‚Äôs probably why Portugal scored so much versus South Korea and pulled off a hat trick with Ronaldo on the bench.They were able to play more freely.Now on to Messi, he is more of a dribiller and he doesn't always need the ball and when he does get the ball remember he will pass if he needs to.

So now there's my debate. Post your debate.

It wasn't true last world cup and it's not true now. 

The man has aged and he has far better players around him (which shows his influence to the game in Portugal) than he did when at his peak. 

The problem has been that when he is on the field our attack is far less diverse than it should, especially given our great midfielders. Without the superstar the game just flows better. 

He is not treated as another attacking option but as the main one and simply shouldn't anymore. He can't, nor does he need to, 1v11 like he did. 

He should be treated as a second half sub. A full power Roni coming in vs a defense that's not at 100% and tired sounds devasting to the other team.",1670376849.0

# Riots in EU cities after Moroccan wins

As the title says, there has been so many riots in the larger EU cities after a Moroccan win.

\- Why does this happen?

\- What would you suggest to stop this

its just outragious. The country you support, with a Morrocan background WINS against multipile (big) football nations, yet ""you"" (Not you, but your fellow Morrocans(?) ) tend to riot in multipule large cities. Why, just why? please make me understand the matter because I lost track..

To all Moroccans who'm didn't riot, congrats on your victory! absolutely amazing you won vs Spain. A proper title contender.

Since 2016 it‚Äôs been a whole different story, and England now are finally a genuine Elite side again - who could win this World Cup; I say could as France, Brasil and Argentina are hardly going to shrink in the fire. 

Anyway, I know this is officially the result of the FA and Southgate implementing a more mature, professional approach to our game, but a part of me believe there is a deeper force at work. The reason we spent 50 years cursed to fail so gloriously, was one simple reason; between 1921-1971, we banned Women‚Äôs football in England. The 50 years of hurt and not even a sniff at a trophy, was karmic punishment for the creator of the beautiful game stopping an entire gender from doing so. 

And it makes sense. The women have flourished since 2015, and are now Euro Champions, and the men are finally a legitimate Elite side - as opposed to overt arrogant and optimist. 

It could be a load of nonsense, but I feel there is logic to this. Anyone care to shit all over this, or offer additional points?

Do you guys feel that the World Cup is going too fast and possibly one more knockout stage might have made sense?",1670317007.0

12 groups of 4 (A-L)

USA in Group A, Canada in Group G, Mexico in Group J

This ensures that the earliest these teams can meet is the semi final. Possible for two to meet in the final. 2002 World Cup Hosts Japan and Korea were kept apart so that they could potentially meet in the final. 

- Group winners and runners up advance to round of 24 and go to different sides of bracket so that they cannot meet until final.

- Winners advance to 2nd Group Stage

**2nd Group Stage**

The 2nd Group Stage features dynamic scheduling to eliminate a dead rubber in the third game. No draws are allowed, and a winner will be determined in extra time or penalties if necessary.

- Group M - Winners of Matches A1 vs B2 (73), C1 vs D2 (74) and E1 vs F2 (75)

- Group N - Winners of Matches G1 vs H2 (76), I1 vs J2 (77) and K1 vs L2 (78)

- The winner of the first match rests. The loser plays the next match against the team that hasn‚Äôt played. There are two scenarios which can occur after the second game. 
- Using Teams A1, C1 and E1 as an example, if A1 beats C1 and then E1 beats C1, A1 and E1 have one win each. C1 is eliminated with 0 wins. A1 and E1 are yet to play each other and the winner takes all. 
- However if Team C1 beats Team E1, then A1 and C1 would have one win each, with C1 having played both its games. E1 would have to beat A1 to have a chance, whilst A1 needs a win to advance. 
- If all 3 teams end up with 1 win each, it will come down to tie breakers such as goal difference, goals scored, penalties differential, penalties scored, fair play, then lots. An extra time win counts in goal difference. A game decided on penalties counts as plus or minus goal difference for both teams. It would mean the loser of the first match would need to win comfortably to give them self a chance. 

A few examples of 2nd Group Stage games where tie breakers may be needed: 

GD is goal difference, GS is goals scored  
PD is penalty differential, PS is penalties scored

*Example 1*

USA 2 d Denmark 0, 
Denmark 4 d Spain 1

USA 1 win, +2 GD, 2 GS  
Denmark 1 win, +1 GD, 4 GS  
Spain 0 wins, -3 GD, 1 GS

Spain would need to beat USA 4-0 and USA would need just to win. Denmark would need Spain to win by 2 or 3 goals

*Example 2*

USA 0 d Denmark 0, 3-1 pens, 
Denmark 4 d Spain 1

USA 1 win, 0 GD, 0 GS, +2 PD, 3 PS  
Denmark 1 win, +3 GD, 4 GS, -2 PD, 1 PS  
Spain 0 wins, -3 GD, 1 GS, 0 PD, 0 PS

Spain would need to beat USA 6-0 and USA would just need to win. Denmark would need Spain to win by 5 goals or less. 

*Example 3*

USA 0 d Denmark 0, 4-2 pens, 
Denmark 0 d Spain 0, 3-0 pens

USA 1 win, GD 0, GS 0, PD +2. PS 4  
Denmark 1 win, GD 0, GS 0, PD +1, PS 5  
Spain 0 wins, GD 0, GS 0, PD -3, PS 0

Spain would need to beat USA in reg or score in extra time and win 3-0 penalties. otherwise. Denmark would hope it goes to penalties and Spain wins on penalties. Otherwise USA advances. 

- Winner of each group advances to Semi Finals

**Semi Finals**

*Day 28*  
Match 97: Winner Group M vs Winner Group N

*Day 29*  
Match 98: Winner Group O vs Winner Group P

**Third Place**

*Day 32*  
Match 99: Loser Match 97 vs Loser Match 98

**Final**

*Day 33*  
Match 100: Winner Match 97 vs Winner Match 98

**Pros**

- Keeping with tradition, groups of 4 will be implemented meaning every team will play a minimum of 3 games 
- Also as tradition, the top two in each group advance therefore it won‚Äôt get messy with best ranked 3rd teams going through 
- The schedule can be organised to fit in 33 days, 1 more day then the usual 32 days for a 32 team World Cup. 
- Collusion is not possible with the 2nd Group Stage as only one team advances from each group. Therefore 2 teams can‚Äôt conspire to both get through. 

**Cons**

- The semi finalists will play 8 games, 1 more than the current 7.
- There will be mostly 6 1st Group Stage matches on one day which may be too much. Scheduling times would have to be tight to fit all in one day with television viewing as well.
- Each team will have a bye in the 2nd Group Stage meaning some teams will have more rest days than others. The team that lost its first match then won the second would have to wait a few more days until the other game has finished to see if they have advanced. 

**Review of format**

- While this format is not perfect I think it solves a few issues, especially getting down to 4 teams with a potentially fair method. I feel this format is mainly straightforward to understand. It also allows for the drama that we saw in the 2022 Group Stage to still occur. 
- Funnily enough this is not the first time a 2nd Group Stage has been used and with 3 teams in each group. The 1982 World Cup used a 2nd Group Stage of 4 groups of 3 with winners going to semi final stage after its 1st Group Stage of 24 teams. It had 2 group stage winners and a runner up in some groups and 1 group winner and 2 runner ups in others which seems unfair. This format negates that as only winners from Round of 24 go through. The 2nd Group Stage make up of each group uses a pre-determined order. 
- Collusion is possible with the 1st Group Stage even with simultaneous games on match day 3. This can already occur with the 32 team group stage format. There are 81 possible scenarios after the first 2 Matchdays in a group, and 8 of them can only result in possibly collusion. 9.87% chance of collusion in group stage scenarios. When the top two teams play each other in match day 3, if the 2nd team is 3 points ahead of 3rd they can conspire to both advance regardless of who wins the other game.
An example of this: Team 1 4pts, Team 4 4pts, Team 2 1pt, Team 3 1pt. Team 1 and Team 4 conspire to draw. This scenario possibly happened in 2018 World Cup with Group C - France, Denmark, Australia and Peru. France and Denmark only needed a draw, and lo and behold they drew. 
- The most contentious issue of this format may be the 2nd Group Stage with one team not playing whist 2 other teams in the group are. With the right tweaks issues could be minimised.
