# Testing - Practical Exercise

Examine [buggy.py](buggy.py)

- There are (at least) four bugs in the code. How many can we find?
- It's impossible to find them all. Why?
- Are the comments helpful? Why do you think comments in the code might (or might not) be helpful in real code?

Examine [buggy_doctests.py](buggy_doctests.py) and [run_doctests.sh](../../run_doctests.sh)

- What has changed?
- What happens when we run `run_doctests.sh`?
- Can we find more bugs now?
- Can we find them all?

Examine [test_buggy.py](test_buggy.py) and [run_tests.sh](../../run_tests.sh)

- What has changed?
- What happens when we run `run_tests.sh`?
- Can we find more bugs now?
- Can we find them all?
